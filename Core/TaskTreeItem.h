/** TaskTreeItem is a node in the task tree.
    The tasks form a tree, since tasks can belong to a parent task.
    This structure is modeled by storing TaskTreeItems in a map that
    associates them with the respective task id.
    Every TaskTreeItem has a parent that represents the parent
    task. If a task has no parent, it is a child of the root
    TaskTreeItem stored in the model.
    Every TaskTreeItem keeps a list of children.
    Every TaskTreeItem also has a position in it's parents list of
    children. This integer position can be retrieved by calling row on
    the item.
