/** TaskListMerger merges two task lists into a single one.
 *
 * It merges the existing tasks in oldtasks with the possibly new
 * state in newtasks.
 *
 * There are a number of assumptions in the merge algorithm: First of
 * all, it assumes tasks never get deleted. Instead of deleting them,
 * they would be marked as expired by setting their valid-until
 * date. Second (based on the first assumption), tasks that exist in
 * oldtasks but not in newtasks are assumed to be locally added, and
 * left untouched. Third, tasks are recognized by their task id.
 *
 * If a task id exists in newtasks, but not in oldtasks, the task is
 * assumed new. If a task id exists in both lists, but differs,
 * newtasks is assumed to contain the newer state, and the returned
 * list will contain the task as it was in newtasks.
